# Data Science Projects in R
This Repository contains my data science projects coded in R language. 

## Project 1 : [Rise and Fall of Programming Languages](https://github.com/subhroisback/data-science-projects-R/blob/master/rise_fall_notebook.ipynb)
<p>Description: Analyzed the relative popularity of programming languages over time based on Stack Overflow data</p>
<p>Skills and Tools:</p>**R, ggplot2, Data Analysis**

## Project 2 : [Factor Analysis on Consumer Perception towards Cereal Brands]()
Description: Consumer perceptions towards a brand can be built on various parameters depending upon the product. This project uses factor analysis to evaluate and identify the most significant attributes that contribute towards the consumer perception of the different cereal brands.
Skills and Tools: **R, Factor Analysis, Advanced Statistics, Analytics**

## Project 3 : [Built a classification model to cluster Engineering Colleges into different groups]()
Description: K-Means Clustering algorithm was applied to the Aggregated Survey Data from 26 Engineering colleges. A classification model was built to classify Engineering colleges into different groups based upon multiple relevant parameters. 
Skills and Tools: **R, Cluster Analysis, Data Mining, K Means Clustering**

## Project 4 : [Neural Network model on Employee Attrition]()
Description: The project investigates the factors that cause employee attrition in organizations. An employee attrition model was built using moderate neural network model and random forest. After generating common performance parameters for both the models, an ensemble model was created that identified the cause of employee attrition.
Skills and Tools: **R, Neural Networks, Data Mining, CART**

## Project 5 : [Built a logistic regression model to predict customer churn in the Telecom industry]()
Description: The primary objective was to investigate the parameters contributing for customer churn (attrition) in the Telecom Industry. A Logistic Regression Model was developed and validated with test data to predict customer churn.
Skills and Tools: **R, Logistic Regression, Predictive Modeling**
